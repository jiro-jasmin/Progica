# Progica 🏠

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is an online reservation service for holiday cottages in France 🏡  
Scroll to find your dream cottage or search with the different filters to find the perfect fit for you!  
Moreoever, there is a custom admin panel to access the database 👨‍💻  
The use of a panel is recommanded for security (e.g prevents user from entering errors in the database with PHPMyAdmin) while also being more user-friendly for non-developers.

Infortunately, there is no online demo at the moment.
